# go-docs-links
Tired of clicking links to source code for standard library and x packages and being redirected to google's code browser rather than github? These browser extensions fix that by changing the documentation links to github.com rather than cs.opensource.google. This only effects links to source code: types, functions, go.mod, and the "Source Files" section at the bottom of each page. Lastly, it only works on standard library and x packages.
